# ❤️ Heart Disease Expert System (Prolog)

A rule-based expert system developed in Prolog to diagnose different types of heart diseases based on user-reported symptoms.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a symbolic AI-based expert system using Prolog.  
The system interacts with the user by asking a series of yes/no questions and applies rule-based reasoning to infer the most probable heart disease.

It was developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence academic project.

## 🧠 AI Concepts Implemented

- Rule-Based Expert System
- Knowledge Representation using IF–THEN Rules
- Backward Chaining Inference
- Symbolic Artificial Intelligence
- Logical Reasoning in Prolog

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system follows the classical expert system model:

User → Interface → Knowledge Base → Inference Engine → Diagnosis

### Components:

- **User Interface** – Collects symptom input from user
- **Knowledge Base** – Contains disease-symptom rules
- **Inference Engine** – Applies backward chaining
- **Output Module** – Displays predicted disease

---

## 🩺 Diseases Covered

The system includes rule sets for:

- Ischemia
- Angina
- Heart Attack
- Heart Failure
- Congenital Heart Defects
- Cardiomyopathy
- Valvular Heart Disease
- Heart Arrhythmias

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Prolog (Visual Prolog / Turbo Prolog compatible)
- Rule-Based Logic Programming

---

## 📂 Project Structure

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Install a Prolog interpreter (Visual Prolog, Turbo Prolog, or compatible environment).
2. Open the file:


3. Run the main predicate:


4. Enter the patient’s name.
5. Answer the yes/no (y/n) questions.
6. The system will display the predicted disease.

## 📊 Features

- Interactive symptom-based diagnosis
- Multiple disease hypotheses
- Backtracking-based logical reasoning
- Simple command-line interface
- Structured rule-based knowledge system

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Deterministic rule matching (all required symptoms must match)
- No probabilistic reasoning
- No certainty factor model
- No confidence score output
- Possible repetition of shared symptoms

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add Certainty Factor (CF) model
- Implement Fuzzy Logic for uncertainty handling
- Optimize inference using dynamic fact storage
- Add explanation facility ("Why this diagnosis?")
- Expand medical knowledge base
